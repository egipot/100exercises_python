# ardit Answer: 

# import json
 
# d = {"employees":[{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"},
#                 {"firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Smith"},
#                 {"firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Jones"}],
# "owners":[{"firstName": "Jack", "lastName": "Petter"},
#           {"firstName": "Jessy", "lastName": "Petter"}]}
 
# with open("company1.json", "w") as file:
#     json.dump(d, file, indent=4)
# Explanation:

# As you can see, we created the json file using the standard file handling method, 
# but then we used json.dump which makes it easy to write the dictionary content to the file. 
# The argument indent=4  will create 4 white spaces to indent the different levels of the dictionary items.


# Expected output: 
# Hint 1: This can be done through the json built-in module.
# Hint 2: Use open  to create a file named something like company1.json  and use json.dump  to write the dictionary to the file.
