Then, we check the next conditions in the next two if  conditionals and keep adding messages to notes . We also check if the length of notes  is zero because it if is, that means there was no message added there, which means the password is fine. Lastly, under else , we iterate through the constructed list and print out its items (i.e., messages)."
